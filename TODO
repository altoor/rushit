BUGS:
* Clang static analyzer shows points out some issues, run `scan-build
  make` to investigate
* logging to standard error doesn't work when the process is launched
  from a directory that is not writable (i.e. can't create a log file)
* MSG_MORE will never get exercised with request/response workload
  because the buffer size is determined from request/response size.
* Reads from socket error queue when edge-trigger epoll in use should
  probably be retired until EAGAIN.
* Use time of last received packet for throughput/TPS calculation.
* Flows for client sockets are never destroyed.

TESTS:
* Add a test runner (Avocado?)

BUILD:
* Import cmocka into the source tree?
* support for out-of-source-tree builds
* Check for tests dependencies (cmocka, Avocado)

COSMETIC/QUALITY:
* replace #ifndef NEPER_... header include guards with #pragma once
* move library sources under lib/ and program sources under src/
* Merge *_main.c modules into workload modules?  The former don't
  serve much purpose apart from parting command line options.
* Stop passing around struct callbacks.
* Introduce x*alloc() wrappers that terminate process on OOM.
* Split up received bytes/transactions sampling at regular intervals
  from intialization of rusage stats (rusage_start) and wall-clock
  time (time_start) at the start of the run. They are not related.
* Switch -v and -V short flags as being verbose is used more often
  than querying version. This also will make us compatible with
  netperf in this regard.
