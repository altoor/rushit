BUGS:
* Clang static analyzer shows points out some issues, run `scan-build
  make` to investigate
* logging to standard error doesn't work when the process is launched
  from a directory that is not writable (i.e. can't create a log file)

BUILD:
* import cmocka into the source tree
* support for out-of-source-tree builds

COSMETIC:
* replace #ifndef NEPER_... header include guards with #pragma once
* move library sources under lib/ and program sources under src/
