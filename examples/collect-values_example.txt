This is a demonstration of how data can be passed from client/server
threads to the main thread running the script by marking values for
collection with `collect()`.

Run a TCP stream server with 5 threads. As socket hook for each of the
server threads gets invoked they print out their socket descriptor
number.

server $ ./tcp_stream -T5 --script ./examples/collect-values.lua
[... output trimmed ...]
10 11 14 16 18

From another terminal run a TCP stream client with 10 threads. The
client threads will also print out socket descriptor numbers.

client $ ./tcp_stream -c -l2 -F10 -T10 --script ./examples/collect-values.lua
[... output trimmed ...]
17 18 20 24 26 22 28 32 31 34

Wait for the test run to finish. Now both client and server process
will run the second part of the script which simply prints out again
the socket descriptors numbers that the threads have been using.

[... client output cont'd ...]
26 17 20 24 18 28 22 32 34 31
[... output trimmed ...]
client $

[... server output cont'd ...]
16 10 11 14 18
[... output trimmed ...]
server $
